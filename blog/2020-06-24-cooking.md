Quarantine has me learning to cook! I'm nowhere near as good as my Mom is, but she's given me several good beginner-friendly recipes to learn with. If you try them out and enjoy the meal, let me know so I can tell her! I'll be updating it over time as I try new things.

I'm using Notion to track all the recipes. Notion is a fantastic application - I've been slowly using it for more and more documents after I discovered it via [Chris Coyier](https://css-tricks.com/how-ive-been-using-notion-personally-and-professionally/).
