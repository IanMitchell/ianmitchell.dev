title: Amazon affiliate links are the scourge of reviews

excerpt: Amazon affiliate links have lead to an increase in SEO-bait "review lists" that just regurgitate the top ten products
---

I'm becoming more and more frustrated with the amount of Amazon affiliate links that are flooding the internet. Whenever I search for product reviews, comparisons, or "best of" lists, the first few pages of results are littered with websites that appear to be gaming [SEO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization). Their articles just post product descriptions mixed with simple "review" language, and inevitably are followed by a large call-to-action button that's an Amazon affiliate link to the product. There are swaths of these websites - and it makes sense, they're likely cheap to run and are decently profitable.

I don't know what to do these days in order to find solid review outlets that I can trust. They all come off as barely-veiled advertisements funded by Amazon. I've started turning to YouTube, since I can at least tell if the reviewer has actually purchased the product they're talking about.

[Wirecutter](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/) used to be my go-to, but I'm noticing their reviews are Amazon dominated too - I've been researching Ring Lights to improve my remote workspace, and [Wirecutter's list was almost all Amazon product links](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-ring-lights/#how-we-picked). Several other of their articles I looked at had similar patterns. The top of Wirecutter's website features the disclaimer:

> Wirecutter is reader-supported. When you buy through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.

Which, kudos for them for clearly stating that, but... frankly it sucks. I know they do actually purchase and review these products, but I can't shake the nagging feeling that the process is shifty and underhanded.
