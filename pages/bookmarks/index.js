      <p>
        Over the years I've accumulated a lot of web design and development
        bookmarks. Some I read every year, some I hold on to just in case I need
        them someday. I read once that you can think of it as lazy-loading
        information - you might not read a tutorial and commit it to memory, but
        you save it so when you do need that information you know where to go to
        look.

          Look, everything here is objectively stellar content, but sometimes...
          there are stars within stars.

          These posts and people are ones that I keep coming back to, either
          because they deeply impacted my development as a web developer or
          because their content is consistently amazing.

            This article has influenced how I approach web development for years
            now. A lot of it has since become relatively mainstream, but there
            are still sections that need a slightly more-conscious approach.

            Is seven a lucky number or something? Look, I'm a developer first
            and foremost. I know a good design when I see one, and I definitely
            can point out UX and UI issues in an existing design. But if you sat
            me down and asked me to develop something from scratch, I'd have a
            real rough time of it. I've read several articles over the years
            that teach you how to do styles, but this article was incredibly
            helpful teaching me <em>fundamentals</em>. 'Course, I still violate
            these all the time, but that's on me.

          I've been saying this for over four years, but I need to launch this
          redesign without codifying my 400+ links.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's just that every time I start, I start worrying and overthinking
          it. How do I check for dead links? What if a link shows up twice? What
          if I want to do things like auto-pull the website favicon? Bunch of me
          problems, I know.
