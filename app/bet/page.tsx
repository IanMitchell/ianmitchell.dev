				My friend Staffan and I have a dumb recurring yearly bet on Seattle
				sports. The bet revolves around the Seattle Mariners and Seattle
				Sounders. If the Mariners make the playoffs, I pay Staffan $2. If the
				Sounders make it to the Western Conference Finals, Staffan pays me $2.
				On paper, that sounds heavily weighted in his favor. AND YET. The
				Mariners have made the playoffs once since 2001, and the Sounders are an
				elite team.

			<p>
				I update the running totals once a year, some time around October and
				November depending on the results.
