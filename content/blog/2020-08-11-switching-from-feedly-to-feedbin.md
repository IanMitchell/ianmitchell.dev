title: Switching from Feedly to Feedbin

I switched to using Feedbin as my RSS reader today. Previously I had been using Feedly, but Feedbin's design and simplicity were more appealing to me. While I migrated my content over I noticed Feedbin added higher resolution favicons for about 50% of the blogs which was a nice surprise.

I used the switch as an opportunity to revamp the list of blogs I subscribe to - while trying to add new websites I noticed ones I follow built on Next.js and Gatsby commonly don't have RSS feeds. Gatsby has an [official plugin](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/tree/master/packages/gatsby-plugin-feed) for adding an RSS feed to your website - if you aren't using it yet, please do! If you're on Next.js [check out my article on how to add RSS to your website](https://ianmitchell.dev/blog/building-a-nextjs-blog-rss).

I've downloaded [NetNewsWire](https://ranchero.com/netnewswire/) to use as my reader application. This is likely nostalgia talking having grown up using Reeder, but I prefer the three column layout to accordion style displays.

It feels good to invest more in RSS.
