My friend and I made a bet back in 2017 that we renew annually. Each year, I bet $2 that the Seattle Mariners won't make the playoffs, and he bets $2 that the Seattle Sounders won't make it to the Western Conference finals. It's an interesting one because we both are Seattle natives, so the ideal scenario is a wash - the Mariners make it to the playoffs (-$2), and the Sounders make it to the Conference finals (+$2). On paper, the odds look like they are extremely against me. When you look more closely though, the Mariners haven't made the playoffs in [19 years](https://www.forbes.com/sites/maurybrown/2020/11/09/as-kyle-lewis-wins-al-rookie-of-the-year-award-mariners-bleak-playoff-drought-may-soon-end/?sh=54bad1575e3a) and the Sounders have made it to the Western Conference finals [four times in the last five years](https://www.seattletimes.com/sports/sounders/sounders-will-make-their-usual-appearance-in-western-conference-final/).

As of 2020 I'm +$12. 2018 is the only year we went even, and it was because the Mariners didn't make playoffs (+$2) and the Sounders didn't make the Western Conference finals (-$2). This was, unfortunately, the worst result we could have hoped for.

We both hope the best case scenario happens someday. Maybe 2021.
