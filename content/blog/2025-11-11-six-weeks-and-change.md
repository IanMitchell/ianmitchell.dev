# Six Weeks and Change

Mimi and I welcomed our son Isaac on September 26th. We're coming up on seven weeks this upcoming Friday; it's been all the usual things you hear. A blur, a whirlwind, sleepless, fun, terrifying, exhilarating, we've been through it all (and yet, we've been through nothing at the same time).

I'm fortunate enough to have a longer paternity leave than most fathers do - Vanta has been wonderful there. I’ve realized I hadn’t valued it as a perk appropriately before. Additional weeks off is worth more than gold.

If you know me somewhat well, you can probably read behind the lines and guess the origin of Isaac's name. Mimi knows!
