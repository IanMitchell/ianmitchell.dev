# The Next Redesign

New year, new domain, new me, "old" technology. I moved my personal website over to a `.dev` domain and I switched frameworks back to Next.js! Why the flip-flop? Next.js recently added several new methods that create a nice way of [generating static websites](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-9-4) and it fit what I've been wanting for a while now. Getting MDX to work with it has been a bit of a pain, but I'm optimistic that the plugins will improve over time. The problems are do-it-once type fixes too.

My goal with this redesign was to enable and prioritize more short-form content and different types of posts. I've been trying to learn photography, so I wanted to better support things like photo entries. While working on the redesign I've written some new posts to test out the layout system - hope you like them!

The current plan is to ship the website early while there are still things unfinished, and before the design is really finalized and [fun](https://whimsical.club). We'll see how that turns out, but let me know if you have any feedback!
