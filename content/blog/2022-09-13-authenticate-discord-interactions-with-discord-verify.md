title: Authenticate Discord Interactions with `discord-verify`

I just published an npm package called [discord-verify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord-verify) that helps verify Discord Interactions. It's far more performant than [discord-interactions](https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord-interactions) is, but it's also a little less flexible. Check out the README for some real user metrics collected by [Truth or Dare Bot](https://truthordarebot.xyz) - they were more impressive than I had expected.

If you run a JavaScript HTTP Discord bot, check discord-verify out!
