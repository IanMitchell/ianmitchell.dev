# Periodic Design Refresh

I just clicked merge on a suite of design changes for my site. I changed less than I normally do when I ship a redesign, even though it may not look that way visually. I pulled in a lot of elements from the [0x57 design language](https://0x57.studio) I’ve been working on over the years.

I also dropped all the frontmatter from my markdown. I now pull the date and title from the filename directly, and have the h1 defined in the post content itself. I’ve been building towards this outcome slowly over the last few years, inspired by [this post by Jim Nielson](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2022/markdown-sans-front-matter/). I also use iA Writer to write my posts, but I don’t use the tagging system he does; I don’t publish near enough posts to warrant that.

There are a couple of issues I’m working through, especially with the new dark mode. But it’s good enough now to ship instead of sitting on it.
