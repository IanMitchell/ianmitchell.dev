I’ve written in past years about how I used Notion to track recipes. I moved to Mela a while ago and haven’t looked back. It’s the first recipes app that I’ve stuck with after trying and churning off other recipe apps recommended by friends.

It’s a small thing, and I’m sure other recipe apps offer this functionality, but the ability to plan what I’m cooking for the week and then send selected ingredients straight to iOS’s Reminders app into an automatically sorted grocery list saves a ton of time each week.

The design and aesthetic is top notch. Check Mela out if you like high quality, well designed apps!
