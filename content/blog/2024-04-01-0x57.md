I’ve been working with [Leah Lundqvist](https://twitter.com/LeahLundqvist) on a new project we’ve named 0x57 (pronounced Hex 57, or W). The two of us have been building this for a while now - we began brainstorming this project in early July when she was visiting Seattle. We’ve been coding it in our spare time, and recently hit a point where we felt comfortable sharing information about what we’ve been cooking up.

I’m an engineer to the core - I don’t have much talent when it comes to visual designing. When you only have two engineers working on a project, though, well... you have to make do. I’ve been working on a visual design language for several months now, incessantly bouncing ideas and mockups off (very patient) friends in a Discord server. Leah and I eventually landed on something that currently looks like this:

There is a lot of work to do, but we’re pretty happy where things are at right now. We feel this is sometime we can ship and iterate on.

[Leah tweeted out a screenshot](https://twitter.com/LeahLundqvist/status/1774137580612702222) yesterday, and the response has been phenomenal. It’s been exhilarating to see friends and [people](https://twitter.com/alistaiir/status/1774167602404737327) [I](https://twitter.com/m1guelpf/status/1774158916160537070) [admire](https://twitter.com/luciascarlet/status/1774294147739881582) positively comment about the design.

Perhaps the best moment was when Theo pulled up the image on his birthday stream, and commented on the ID breakout I had made just a handful of days earlier

I’ll talk more about 0x57 in the future (and not just the emotions of yesterday!) but after seeing the interest yesterday, Leah and I opened a Discord server to share project updates in. [Feel free to join!](https://discord.gg/pXtwPpHDAh)
