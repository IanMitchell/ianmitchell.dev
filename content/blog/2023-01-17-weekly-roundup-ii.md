Little bit late on this one due to distracting weekend plans (I got engaged!), but here is volume 2 of "the list of things I read this week".

1. **[OKLCH in CSS: why we moved from RGB and HSL](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/oklch-in-css-why-quit-rgb-hsl)** - I've been reading about OKLCH over the last week or two. It seems like this format is the "winner" of a bunch of new color formats CSS has gotten in recent years.
2. **[Year in Review 2022: Tenderlove's Ruby and Rails Reflections and Predictions](https://shopify.engineering/ruby-rails-year-in-review-2022)** - If you're interested in Ruby, follow Tenderlove! This article is a great overview of the cool things happening in Ruby.
3. **[Coyier's Edge Law](https://chriscoyier.net/2023/01/15/coyiers-edge-law/)** - I don't use serverless for much. I find that if one of my serverless projects finds any success, I'll have to rewrite it in Fastify since it quickly gets cost prohibitive. Most recently, my [Sentry â†’ Discord](https://sentrydiscord.dev) project went from $0/mo to $20/mo to $60/mo in the span of 8 weeks. I do think Edge networks offer more compelling benefits though, and I think Chris suggests an interesting angle to look at them with.
4. **[IXION | Original Soundtrack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhTXyUERugQ)** - An absolutely fantastic soundtrack.
5. **[Builderbook](https://book.buildergroop.com/)** - A resource put together by my friends at Buildergroop. I learned a lot when I read through it!
6. **[Gemfile of dreams: the libraries we use to build Rails apps](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/gemfile-of-dreams-libraries-we-use-to-build-rails-apps)** - Big fan of Rails, big fan of Evil Martians. I discovered some new gems from this list.
7. **[T3 App](https://create.t3.gg)** - I got linked to this after a recent spat of Twitter drama. I don't claim to understand the social aspects, but this T3 resource is interesting - and helpful, I think. I agree with a lot of the points, even if I disagree with some of the technical choices. Reading the list of recommendations did push me to look into new frameworks like tRPC.
