# Pokémon GO Avatar

I'm a little late on posting this, but I made a really simple [Pokémon GO Avatar Generator](https://pokemon-cre3xe0l1-ianmitchell1.vercel.app) over the summer. It was mostly a proof-of-concept test for me to see how hard it would be to combine different canvas layering effects on an image and then save the result.

There were some fun challenges along the way - writing ES5 JavaScript without using Babel / jQuery / other similar tools was interesting, as was circumventing Google Chrome limits on file size when downloading something. They were a lot of fun to work through though, and I learned a lot because of them.

You can find the [source code for the project](https://github.com/IanMitchell/ianmitchell.io/tree/master/projects/pokemon) on GitHub.
