Over the past few weeks I've slowly been colocating all of my notifications and project channels into a new Discord server - I realized it would be the perfect place to open up for collaboration, bug reports, or feature requests.

If you'd like to come ask me questions or collaborate on things, [drop by](https://discord.gg/ian)!
