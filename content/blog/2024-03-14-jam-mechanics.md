My friend [Bug Hunter](https://bughunterbug.com) launched a new podcast a few weeks ago where he and [The Narcissist Cookbook](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheNarcissistCookbook) challenge each other to write a song within a time limit based on a prompt they give each other. Iâ€™ve been enjoying it - give it a listen! Not only is there good music but the banter is excellent too.
