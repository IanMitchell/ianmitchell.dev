Vercel [recently shipped support for Bun](https://vercel.com/blog/bun-runtime-on-vercel-functions) which is something I've been waiting for for what feels like a long time. I've been using Bun for personal scripts and services running on Railway - I'm excited for some of them to be ported back to Vercel. I've found using Bun serve for things like webhook handlers is fantastic, and now I can deploy those projects on serverless.

I just [updated this website to run on Bun](https://github.com/IanMitchell/ianmitchell.dev/pull/30). I took the time to do some maintenance while I was at it; the newer versions of Next.js have sorely needed DX improvements. Compared to previous version updates, this one was painless.

The new `"use cache";` directive allowed me to delete a fair chunk of code, which I'm always happy about!
