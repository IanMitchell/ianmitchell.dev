# On Simplifying

Alright, so last year my endeavor to write weekly blog posts flared out pretty quickly. Part of that was work burnout (I’ve since left Discord and joined [Vanta](https://vanta.com)) and part of it was some frustrations with MDX and the build process of my website. I tried to do some tech upgrades after my Weekly Roundup II article, and ended up with a broken mess of dependencies. I couldn't get things to work, threw in the towel, and left the website to sit for many months.

I am finally ready to give posting a go again. I just shipped a pseudo-redesign that switches from MDX to Markdown, drops Prism for rehype-pretty-code, uses React Server Components, and cut out the static build process for some side project demonstrations I was hosting. The new website is simpler to write posts for, but is also harder to add interactive content to. Ultimately, I think that’s a good thing. I (hopefully) won't sit on half written articles tinkering with interactive widgets until I lose interest and throw it all out; the process of write->publish is simpler now. A lot of authors I subscribe to recommend making that flow as easy as possible; I think I achieved that.

We’ll see how things work out!
