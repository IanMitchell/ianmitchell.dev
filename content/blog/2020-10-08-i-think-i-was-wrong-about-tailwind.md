# I think I was wrong about Tailwind

Back in June I wrote my [first Tailwind CSS project](/blog/tracking-unpopular-senate-votes) and said on Twitter I probably wouldn't use it again, and that I didn't like certain aspects of it.

I ended up using Tailwind again recently on a larger project, and it's been growing on me a lot. I think I got this wrong initially - I still won't use Tailwind for all my projects, but I think it will show up in more and more of them.

[Apparently I'm not the only one changing their tune](https://www.swyx.io/why-tailwind/).
