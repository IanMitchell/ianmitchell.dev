JavaScript has some excellent formatters in its newer APIs - they're starting to creep into StackOverflow answers, but check these out if you haven't seen them before!

## Formatting Numbers

Want to display a numerical value in a more human-readable format? Use [Number.prototype.toLocaleString()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/toLocaleString).

```javascript file=numbers.js
const value = 1000000;
console.log(value.toLocaleString());
// => "1,000,000"
```

If you're using numbers with units or currencies, [Intl.NumberFormat](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/NumberFormat/NumberFormat) has you covered.

```javascript file=currency.js
const base = 165000;
const amount = 195000;

new Intl.NumberFormat("en-US", {
  style: "currency",
  currency: "USD",
  currencySign: "accounting",
}).format(base - amount);
// => "($30,000.00)"

new Intl.NumberFormat("en-US", {
  style: "percent",
  signDisplay: "exceptZero",
}).format(base / amount);
// => "+85%"
```

## Formatting Lists

Want to format a list of options in a readable format? Rails had a great implmentation with `humanize`, and now JavaScript does too! Check out [Intl.ListFormat](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/ListFormat).

```javascript file=humanize.js
const formatter = new Intl.ListFormat("en", {
  style: "long",
  type: "conjunction",
});

console.log(
  formatter.format(["Soccer", "Politics", "Video Games", "Programming"])
);
// => "Soccer, Politics, Video Games, and Programming"
```

_It even uses the Oxford Comma!_

## Formatting Dates

Unfortunately, the Date API doesn't do well formatting time or durations - but the good news is that the new Temporal API does! The spec has a [fantastic section on formatting](https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/docs/duration.html#toLocaleString). There are a few polyfills available, so you can use Temporal today if you want.
