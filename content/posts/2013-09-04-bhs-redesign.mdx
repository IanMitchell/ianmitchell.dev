During my senior year at [Bainbridge High School (BHS)](http://www.bisd303.org/site/Domain/8), it was announced that the school administration would be looking at upgrading our website. Due to IT costs, they were considering outsourcing the design, development, and hosting to a third party. My Digital Design teacher, Ms. Rose, asked me to create an in-house design mockup to show to the committee in the hopes that they might ask students to create a design instead. It would make our website a bit more personal, and had the potential to save the district a ton of money. I was given less than 24 hours to create a proposal mockup to present as an alternative to the company's design.

## Design Decisions

I wanted to keep the same general structure of the old website, while introducing newer innovations and streamlining the design. It would need to be able to work with a variety of colors depending on the school (for example, while the high school might use white, gold, and blue, Woodward Middle School would use white, green, and brown).

### Image Header

One of the main changes was a rotating image header. Before, a random image was chosen and displayed on each page load -- the feature was a favorite among the community, and themed pictures were put up for events such as Thanksgiving, Winter Break, etc. I expanded on this idea and used the [Nivo Slider](http://dev7studios.com/nivo-slider/) jQuery plugin to display all the images in a rotating banner.

### Footer

Another significant change was the footer -- instead of just having a copyright, I added in some of the most visited links for easier access. I also inserted some other sections that as a team we felt weren't getting enough traffic, such as the "Clubs" and "Outside of School" pages. By putting these links in the footer, I ensured they weren't intruding on the core content while still having increased visibility.

### Mockup

[You can view the proposal mockup here](/projects/bhs). It isn't as clean as I'd like, but given the time constraints not everything could be pixel perfect! Areas of improvement include header padding, colors, tab width, and main content / sidebar styling. The actual content portion of the website is rather plain by design since the teachers liked to add their own "flair", but it could still be improved.

### Old Design

Although a working copy no longer exists, this is a leftover thumbnail of the old design - apologies for the small size!

## Ultimate Outcome

Despite overwhelmingly positive feedback from the community, the committee decided to outsource the design and development of the website. I graduated before the switch occurred.
