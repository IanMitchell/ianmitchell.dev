In no particular order, these are some of the technologies I've been interested in recently and am trying to learn more about:

- **[Prisma](https://www.prisma.io)** - I am in the process of switching [Aquarius](https://aquarius.sh) away from Firebase and over to Prisma. I chose Firebase as the database provider about an hour before I shipped v2 of Aquarius (there is a story there, but it was _A Thing_) and I've been trying to figure out a nice, clean way of migrating back to PostgreSQL ever since. Prisma has been compelling, and I'm hopeful it will be a great library to use with Aquarius now that it's out of beta.
- **[New CSS Colors](https://lea.verou.me/2020/04/lch-colors-in-css-what-why-and-how/)** - This is something I'm trying to learn to stay on top of the ever-changing world of CSS. I've tried to use some of the new color systems in this blog's design!
- **CSS Grid** - Not a new technology, but one I've not spent time with. I wish Subgrid had better support - I've found myself in situations that it would make much easier several times already. I've been using [Layoutit!](https://grid.layoutit.com/) a lot, it's a great tool.
- **Alternatives to Kubernetes** - In all honesty I don't particularly want to learn about this, but I want to have a clean deployment system for Aquarius. DevOps doesn't really interest me, but you gotta do what you gotta do!
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)** - I used Tailwind CSS for my recent [Senate Votes](https://senatevotes.us) project. Overall, I'm not the biggest fan. There are some naming inconsistencies (directional classes sometimes have a `-` separator and sometimes don't) that rubbed me the wrong way, and being pretty pro-CSS I don't think I'm their target market. I'm not sure if I will use it again, but I did like how it incentivized creating composable React components.
- **Abstract Syntax Trees (AST)** - I learned about ASTs to create this blog. I needed to use tools similar to [unified.js](https://unifiedjs.com/) to work with MDX and this website. ASTs are a little dry and not my thing, but they're undeniably powerful and a good way of working with and modifying structures.
- **Swift UI** - A lot of JavaScript and React developers have been praising Swift UI and saying it should be used as a guide for future React work. I want to spend time learning about it to understand what they like about it, and how I could apply its design and philosophy into the systems I work on.
- **[MobileDoc](https://github.com/bustle/mobiledoc-kit)** - I host several blogs on Ghost, but they've been prioritizing email newsletters and membership rather than article features. To be clear, I don't fault them for this, but my personal needs means I'm beginning to investigate spinning up a blog system of my own.
- **[Figma](https://www.figma.com/)** - I'm hoping to achieve competency with Figma. Being able to use design tools is a super important skill for front-end developers - it seems like the design community is moving towards Figma, so I want to learn how to effectively use it.
