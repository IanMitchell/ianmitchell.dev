excerpt: My friend wrote a Discord bot that takes a song link and posts a message that links to that song on all the major music platforms.

My friend [Jack](https://twitter.com/laf0nd) created an incredibly useful Discord bot - my friends all subscribe to different music services, which makes sharing music pretty difficult. With tunes.ninja, you just send it a link to a song and it posts a message with links to the song on all the major music platforms. Everyone loves it - it's a great example of the new Discord button feature too.
