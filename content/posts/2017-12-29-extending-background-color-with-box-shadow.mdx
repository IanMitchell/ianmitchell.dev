_I haven't written anything this year so I figured I'd post a quick tip while I still have some time. I've been busy rewriting this website in React which should be launching soon!_

If you ever have a parent element with a `padding` value and a child element with a `background-color` you'd like to extend into the parent's padding box, you can use `box-shadow` to achieve the effect, as detailed below.
