During my junior year at Cal Poly I joined Tip Trip, a local startup. While my job was to just design and maintain a static website, should we have expanded I would have been tasked with creating a web interface, database, and API to complement apps on other platforms.

## Goal

Our original plan was to ensure students who were out partying could get an easy, safe ride home. They would open the app, find a driver they knew and trusted, and arrange for a ride home. In exchange, they would provide some form of compensation specified by the driver (for instance, a slice of pizza).

## Website Specification

My task was to create an "Apple" inspired website. Although the actual content was never finished, the design was all but finalized.

## Status

Due to several founding members graduating and moving to different parts of the country, this project was put on hold, and eventually cancelled.
