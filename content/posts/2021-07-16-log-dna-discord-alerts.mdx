So turns out I broke [Sentry â†’ Discord](https://sentrydiscord.dev) last week... oops. I have it hooked up to [LogDNA](https://www.logdna.com/) to log events and errors, but I, uh, don't actively check it. After I discovered the issue, I spent a little bit of time setting up a dashboard for it that sends a webhook alert to my Discord channel.

The process was actually surprisingly easy. If you go to Settings -> Alerts under your organization, you can create a custom Webhook that looks like this:

  alt="LogDNA Alert Webhook"
  width={779}
  height={1560}
/>

My custom payload:

````json copy
{
  "username": "LogDNA",
  "avatar_url": "https://assets-global.website-files.com/603024253162e837e0c31b6f/603024253162e8e6eac31e49_LogDNA%20webclip.png",
  "embeds": [
    {
      "title": "{{name}} Alert Triggered",
      "description": "{{line}}\n\n```{{query}}```",
      "url": "{{url}}",
      "color": 16711680,
      "footer": {
        "icon_url": "https://assets-global.website-files.com/603024253162e837e0c31b6f/603024253162e8e6eac31e49_LogDNA%20webclip.png",
        "text": "LogDNA Alert"
      },
      "fields": [
        {
          "name": "Level",
          "value": "{{level}}",
          "inline": true
        },
        {
          "name": "Matches",
          "value": "{{matches}}",
          "inline": true
        },
        {
          "name": "App",
          "value": "{{app}}",
          "inline": true
        },
        {
          "name": "Host",
          "value": "{{host}}",
          "inline": true
        },
        {
          "name": "Tag",
          "value": "{{tag}}",
          "inline": true
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
````

You might want to change the parameters before triggering (on every presence is aggressive - my site doesn't get much traffic), but otherwise just plug a new Discord Webhook URL into the field and go! I made a new view that filters out any non-error log messages and then attached the new alert to it. When executed, it looks like this:

  alt="LogDNA Alert Discord Embed"
  width={429}
  height={303}
/>
