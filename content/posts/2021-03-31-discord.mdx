I joined Discord! This was my first week on the Bots and API team - I'll be working with the group that is implementing slash commands and application interactions. I've been an avid user of Discord since September 2015, and have been building Aquarius on the official Discord API since May 2016. Needless to say, I'm a tad excited. Being able to work on the API itself is an incredible opportunity!
