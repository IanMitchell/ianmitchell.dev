excerpt: Since office coffee is no longer an option, I've had to learn how to brew a better cup myself.

I'm a little late to this compared to the typical Seattleite (I grew up on English Breakfast tea), but it's been fun learning to brew better coffee. I use a French press, and previously used a spice grinder for my beans. It wasn't the best (it certainly was an inconsistent grind) but given how infrequently I made coffee at home the setup worked well enough. That changed pretty quickly when remote work was mandated, and I realized I had to up my game. Nowadays I have a dedicated coffee grinder that is far more consistent, and I also measure out the right ratio of beans. It's made a bigger difference than I thought, and it wasn't hard to do at all.

My friend swears by an Aeropress, so I might check that out next.
