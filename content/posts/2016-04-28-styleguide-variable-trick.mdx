description: You can use CSS to display values that you don't want a user to select and copy

I recently [created a pen](http://codepen.io/IanMitchell/pen/grBvxw) that shows how to use a Sass mixin to display the value of a variable alongside the name, but in a way that doesn't allow the user to select it - no copy pasting the value, just the name!

I did this recently for Zillow's styleguide (we use Less) and figured I'd port it to Sass. The trick is pretty simple in nature - you just assign the value of the variable to the [CSS content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/content) attribute.

  scrolling="no"

  frameBorder="no"
  allowtransparency="true"
  allowFullScreen={true}
  width="100%"

The downside is you won't be able to search for the value - searching for "2ECC40" returns 0 results.
