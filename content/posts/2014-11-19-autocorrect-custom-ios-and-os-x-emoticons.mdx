I'm a big fan of Japanese style text faces; I vastly prefer them to the standard iOS emoji keyboard. Unfortunately, they're pretty difficult to type out. In order to make them a bit more accessible, I use a fun trick I picked up from [@Tenderlove](http://twitter.com/tenderlove). By adding custom replacement phrases to autocorrect, you can use complex text faces quickly.

I've had a lot of friends ask recently how I use these faces, and figured I'd share.
